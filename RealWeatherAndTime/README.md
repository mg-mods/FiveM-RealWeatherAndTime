# Real Weather and Time script [Five-M]

This script allows you to sync the server time and weather with a real-world location using an API. Set the city of your choice and the script will automatically sync game time and weather with this city. Additionally, there is a clean UI that includes all important data.

**Installation**

1. Add the script to your resources folder.

2. Go to **CONFIG.lua** and set your API key and change the city to your choice **(you can get the API key here: https://openweathermap.org/)**.

3. Configure the **CONFIG.lua** as needed.

4. Go to your `server.cfg` and add **start RealWeatherAndTime**. Restart your server.

**IMPORTANT**
To be able to open the AdminWeatherUI as admin you have to enter a valid SteamID/FiveID in the config under Config.AllowedPlayers in the config file.
Open the AdminUI ingame with /openAdminUI

**Important: The script is in the beta phase, so bugs and errors may occur.**
Also, note that scripts like Vsync and easytime are not compatible with this script.
